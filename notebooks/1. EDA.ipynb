    "# Machine learning bank's credit card service churn prediction\n",
    "In this project, I will build a <b>machine learning model to predict customer churn in a bank's credit card service.</b> It involves <b>supervised learning (using a labeled training set) for classification</b>, where the <b>target</b> is <b>1</b> if the <b>customer churned</b>, else <b>0.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the following <b>pipeline</b> based on <b>CRISP-DM framework:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Define the business problem.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>2. Collect the data and get a general overview of it.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>3. Split the data into train and test sets.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>4. Explore the data (exploratory data analysis)</b><br>\n",
    "<b>5. Data cleaning and preprocessing.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>6. Model training, comparison, selection and tuning.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>7. Final production model testing and evaluation.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>8. Conclude and interpret the model results.</b><br>\n",
    "<b>9. Deploy.</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In <b>this notebook</b>, I will perform <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA), covering steps 1 to 4 of the pipeline above.</b> The main <b>objective</b> here is to <b>uncover insights</b> that will give us <b>valuable information about churners' patterns</b> within the available features. Thus, even before building a model, it will be possible to help the bank with some churners profiles and tendencies. Furthermore, I will approach these steps in detail below, explaining why I am making each decision."
